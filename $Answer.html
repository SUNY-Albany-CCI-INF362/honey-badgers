					 <p>If you have received a Summons and 

Complaint, you have the right to serve and 

fi le an Answer to the Complaint. This will help 

you preserve your legal rights and guarantee 

that you receive notice of all future actions 

in the court case, including the sale of your 

home. If you don’t fi le an Answer, the judge 

may enter a “default” judgment against you 

(which means you did not submit an Answer 

and therefore are not contesting the Bank’s 

legal right to foreclosure). In addition, if 

you don’t fi le an Answer you will probably 

lose your right to raise any defenses to the 

foreclosure down the road.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, however, it is not helpful to fi le an Answer. If you are unable to fi nd an attorney 

to help, you will have to make that choice. 

There are two possible reasons why you may 

NOT want to file an Answer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may not have any legal defenses or claims to the foreclosure</li>
            <li>If you file an Answer and are unsuccessful in convincing the judge that you are correct in your claims, you will be responsible for the leaga fees that the Bank must pay to successfully pursue the foreclosure. This willl increase the amount of money you owe the Bank. This increase could ultimately make it harder for you to obtain a loan modifi cation or some other type of workout.</li>

papers were handed to you in person), 

you have 20 days from the date of service 

(the date you were handed the papers) to 

file your Answer.</li>
        <li>• If you were served by mail (you didn’t 

receive a copy personally but instead 

received the foreclosure summons only 

by mail), you have 30 days to fi le your 

Answer.</li>
        <p>If it has been more than 30 days since you 

were served, you may still be able to fi le an 

Answer but you will need to ask permission 

from the Court. One way to approach this 

situation is to draft the Answer, try to fi le 

it with the Court and serve it on the Bank’s 

attorney. The Bank’s attorney may try to claim 

that your Answer is too late to accept, but 

the Court also may decide to allow you to fi le 

your Answer, so it is worth trying.</p>
