	<p>This can happen for any
number of reasons, but the end result is the
same: your financial situation is such that
you have not been able to keep current on
your Mortgage. Each Mortgage has specific
language about when the Bank may begin
a foreclosure proceeding. For instance, we
often see mortgages that say if a homeowner
falls more than 3 months behind on
payments, the Bank can begin foreclosure
proceedings.</p>

						<p>It may be a loss of a job, or a
								cut in your pay rate. Perhaps you have just
								gone through a divorce, or had a major
								medical concern. Whatever the reason is,
								you have fallen behind on your mortgage
								payments. When this happens, often times
								homeowners are put in the no-win situation
								of paying all their other bills, or paying their
								mortgage. There is really no “right” answer to
								this question, because whichever bill doesn’t
								get paid has the possibility of leading to
								negative consequences. If it is the Mortgage
								that doesn’t get paid, the Bank will begin
								contacting you to find out when you will
								make your missed payments. Homeowners
								often will ignore these calls, because they
								know they cannot make the payment in the
								foreseeable future. Perhaps you are able to
								make some payments, so you are always a
								month or two behind. Eventually, you fall
								behind to the point that the Bank is ready to
								threaten you with foreclosure.</p>
