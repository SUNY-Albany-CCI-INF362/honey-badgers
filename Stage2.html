	<p >Under New York State law, the Bank is
required to send you a notice at least 90 days
before the start of a foreclosure proceeding.
Typically, the Bank will send this out when
you are somewhere between 30 and 60 days
behind on your payments. Notices must
be sent to the last known address of the
borrower by registered or certified mail, in
addition to first-class mail. The letter must
state the number of days you are behind
on your Mortgage, the amount of money
owed and the telephone number of the
Bank. It also must provide a list of at least five

						<p>The timing of when you will receive

							letter is <span class=" stages-emphasis-right-assurance">required</span> to be sent to you. The Bank
							must wait at least 90 days from sending this
							letter before they begin a foreclosure action
							against you. This 90-day window gives you

							to find an alternative to foreclosure. This
							notice must tell you how much you must
							pay to bring your loan current. It must also
							provide the names and telephone numbers
