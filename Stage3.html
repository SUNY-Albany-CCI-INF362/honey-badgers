						<p>The timing of when you will receive a
“Demand Letter” depends on the language
in your Mortgage, but typically this will
occur when you are 45 to 60 days behind on
payments. Although the Bank is threatening
to begin a foreclosure proceeding if you
do not pay and may even say that you are
in foreclosure when you contact them, at
this point they have not actually filed any
documents with the Court.
It is <b>important to note </b>that you may receive
a Demand Letter, even if you have contacted
the Bank and have begun to work with them
in trying to work out a plan to get current.
You may have sent lots of documents to
the Bank, which they are actively reviewing.
Regardless of these efforts, you still may
receive a Demand Letter. With many large
Banks, the Demand Letter is automatically
generated when you fall behind by a certain
amount of time on payments. Therefore,
even if you are being reviewed for workout
solutions, you still will receive the Demand
Letter. It does not mean that the Bank
has stopped reviewing your documents.
