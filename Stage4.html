						<p>The Summons and Complaint is what tells
you that a lawsuit has been started. The
Summons and Complaint are created by the
Bank’s attorneys, and throughout them you
will be referred to as the Defendant. The
Summons is usually one of the first pages,
and tells you some basic information about
the lawsuit that has been started. It will tell
you the name of the entity that has filed the
foreclosure against you. This may simply be
the name of your Bank.
However, the <span class=" stages-emphasis-right-assurance">name of the party suing you
may be a long, confusing name that does
not sound familiar to you</span>. For example, you
may see that the Plaintiff is “MORTGAGE
SERVICING AMERICA, AS TRUSTEE FOR
MORTGAGE INDEX 2005-RD4, MORTGAGE
PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES 2005-
RD4 UNDER THE POOLING AND SERVIING
AGREEMENT DATED DECEMEBER 1, 2005.”
The example of a Summons that follows this
section shows an example of one of these
types of trusts. </p>

						</ul>
	<p>The reason this sometimes happens is that
your Bank may have taken your mortgage,
bundled it with hundreds of others, and
sold them on Wall Street. If that was the
case, they created a “Trust” (which is a type
of legal entity) that holds all the mortgages.
Therefore, when a foreclosure is fi led it has to
be the Trust that actually is the Plaintiff .</p>
	<div class="stages-emphasis-warning-assurance"> REGARDLESS OF WHOM YOU
SEE LISTED AS THE PLAINTIFF,
THERE WILL NOT BE ANY REALWORLD
DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE
FORECLOSURE PROCEEDS.</div>
<p>The Complaint tells you and the Court the
reasons the Bank is suing you and what they
are asking the Court to do.</p>

<p> Because this is
a foreclosure, the Bank is claiming you have
not made your monthly payments as you
promised in your Mortgage and Note. When you signed your Mortgage you put your
house up as collateral, in case you could not
pay the amount you borrowed. Now that you
have fallen behind on your payments (also
known as “defaulting”), the Bank is asking the
Court to enforce the terms of the Mortgage.
Terms of the Mortgage typically allow the
Bank to sell your house if you default on your
payments to them. </p>

					<ul><p>When you receive the Summons and
Complaint, you should also receive a notice
that again informs you that help is available
through a <a href="#list_counseling agencies"> housing counseling agency.</a>
 <ul><li>This notice will be on a different colored paper,
and in larger font.</li>
<li> It should list all the HUDapproved
housing counseling agencies .</li>
</ul>
 <div class="stages-emphasis-warning-assurance">If you have not contacted a housing counseling agency
at this point, we once again STRONGLY urge
you to contact one of them and make an
appointment to talk to a counselor.</div>
It is important to note that you may receive
a Summons and Complaint even if you have
begun working with a housing counseling
agency or with the Bank directly. You may
be working with the Bank’s “loss mitigation”
department, which is the group that works
with struggling homeowners to come up with
a plan that allows you to keep your home.
You may have sent in multiple rounds of
documents to the Bank, and may be hopeful
that a solution to your problem is just around
the corner.</p>
<p>However, most large banks have a completely
separate department that deals with fi ling
foreclosures. Therefore, even if you are in
the process of working with the Bank, the
Bank still may start a foreclosure against you.
If that is the case, do not despair. You can
continue to work with the Bank throughout
the foreclosure proceeding. So if they have
asked for more documents, or have told
you they are reviewing your file, you should
continue this process!
</p><p>Once you receive the Summons and
Complaint, it is<div class="stages-emphasis-warning-assurance"> EXTREMELY important that
you open ALL mail sent to you by your Bank’s
attorney, and by the Court.</div> Important notices
about the status of your case will be mailed
to you, and it is critical that you be aware of
these developments.</p>
