file an Answer to the Complaint. This will help 

you preserve your legal rights and guarantee 

that you receive notice of all future actions 

in the court case, including the sale of your 

home. If you don’t file an Answer, the judge 

may enter a “default” judgment against you 

(which means you did not submit an Answer 

and therefore are not contesting the Bank’s 

legal right to foreclosure). In addition, if 

you don’t fi le an Answer you will probably 

lose your right to raise any defenses to the 

foreclosure down the road.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, however, it is not helpful to file an Answer. If you are unable to find an attorney 

to help, you will have to make that choice. 

There are two possible reasons why you may 

NOT want to file an Answer.</p>

	<strong><p>You should use this defense if all six of these 

events happened to you. If you feel that you 

were deceived prior to closing on your loan, 

you believed those deceptions, and as a 

result you were more likely to sign your loan 

documents, you should fill in this section.</p></strong>

<p>Fraud is a defense that must be pleaded with 

particularity – that is to say that you must be 

VERY specific with your allegations. Therefore, 

if you are choosing fraud as a defense you 

must list exactly how the fraud occurred. You 

will need to check any and all of the above 

boxes that you feel accurately state the specific 

fraudulent behavior. If there are other fraudulent 

statements made to you other than the ones in 

the boxes below, check the “Other” box and list 

them out specifically in the lines provided.</p>

			<strong><p>Other Defenses or Counterclaims _________________________</p></strong>


			<p>If you have any other claims you would like to 

tell the court about, list them all here. Be as 

specific as possible and add sheets of paper if 

necessary.</p>

			<p><em>STEP 4: ADD ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

TO THE “OTHER FACTS CONCERNING YOUR 

MORTGAGE” SECTION</em></p>
			<p>This can include facts surrounding any of the 

defenses you have already checked off or any 

other facts that you think the Court should 

know about. This is where you should tell 

your story. Below are some possible ideas 

that could apply to you.<em> Always be as specific 

as possible and attach additional pages if 

needed!</em></p>

			 <ul>
        <li>You were pressured to sign the mortgage

or home purchase documents.
</li>
<li>You were discouraged from using

your own attorney or appraiser or other 

independent advisor.
</li>
<li>You did not receive a financial benefit

from your mortgage.
</li>
<li>The interest rate is extremely high, or

higher than you qualified for given your 

credit history at the time you obtained 

your mortgage. 
</li>
<li>You were charged high closing costs or

fees.
</li>
<li>Your loan application was falsified

(e.g. your income was misstated on your 

application).
</li>
<li>You were told that utilities, medical

expenses, or other bills would be paid off 

by your mortgage, but they weren’t.
</li>
<li>You were told that your house was worth

more than its actual value.
</li>
<li>Your home was in poor condition when

you purchased it and you were promised 

repairs that were never made. </li>

<li>You were falsely told that you could earn

rental income from your home to help pay 

the mortgage. </li>
<li>You believe that you were targeted for an

unfair or abusive mortgage loan based 

on your race, national origin, sex, mental 

or physical disability, age, alienage/

citizenship status, or other legally 

protected characteristic. </li>
 </ul>

<p><strong>STEP 5: FILL IN THE BOTTOM OF THE 4TH PAGE 

WITH YOUR CURRENT CONTACT INFORMATION.</strong></p>

	<p><em>STEP 6: IN FRONT OF A NOTARY PUBLIC, FILL 

OUT AND SIGN THE VERIFICATION SECTION - A</em> 

Verification is a statement under oath that the 

Answer is truthful. After you complete the Answer, 

you MUST sign this verification in front of a Notary 

Public and have them notarize it. You can often 

find a Notary Public at a branch of your local bank. 

Please be aware they may charge you a small fee 

for this service.</p>

<p><em>STEP 7: MAKE 2 COPIES OF THE VERIFIED ANSWER </em>

You will arrange for one copy to be “served” to the 

Plaintiff’s attorney. (See Step 8). You

will keep the second copy for your records.</p>

<p><em>STEP 8: “SERVE” THE PLAINTIFF’S ATTORNEY</em>

Ask someone other than yourself who is at least 

18 years old and not a Defendant in the lawsuit to 

“serve” a copy of the Verified Answer on Plaintiff’s 

attorney at the address listed on the Summons 

and Complaint. The easiest way to “serve” the 

Verified Answer is to arrange for the person to 

send it by certified mail, return receipt requested, 

or by overnight delivery service. Be sure to keep 

the proof of mailing and delivery.</p>

			<p><em>STEP 9: FILL OUT THE AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE

The person who “served” the copy of the 

Verified Answer on the Plaintiff’s attorney 

must fill out the Affidavit of Service in front a 

Notary Public and have it notarized. You can 

often find a Notary Public at a branch of your 

local bank. Please be aware they may charge a 

small fee for this service.</p></div></div>

<p><em>STEP 10: FILE THE VERIFIED ANSWER AND 

AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE AT THE COUNTY CLERK. </em>

Bring the original Verified Answer, the extra 

copy of the Verified Answer, the notarized 

Affidavit of Service, and a copy of the 

notarized Affidavit of Service to your County 

Clerk’s office. (See list of the local area court 

clerks included in the front folder pocket of 

this guide.) At the County Clerk’s office, state 

that you wish to file an Answer. Be sure to ask 

the clerk to “time-stamp” the original Verified 

Answer, the Affidavit of Service and the copy 

of the Verified Answer, so that you have proof 

of the date and time you filed your Answer. 

Keep for your records a time stamped copy of 

the Verified Answer and a copy of the Affidavit 

of Service.</p>

<p>STEP 11: APPEAR AT YOUR SETTLEMENT 

CONFERENCE</p>
