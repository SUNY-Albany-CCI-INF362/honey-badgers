Responsinav
===========

Responsive Multi-Level Navigation jQuery Plugin

Usage
====

Simply include the script file along with jQuery core and then call the function using the following:

$(window).responsinav({ breakpoint: 650 });

Set the breakpoint to where the navigation no longer fits. This can be automated by calculating the 'nav' element's outerWidth()
