    <p>A Notice of Appearance is a document filed
with the Court that alerts the Court that you
would like to be an active participant in the
foreclosure proceeding. By filing a Notice of
Appearance, you are telling the Court that
you want copies of all future relevant legal
documents related to the foreclosure to be
sent to you. (If you have chosen to file an
Answer, you automatically have made this
request and do not need to file a Notice of
Appearance.)</p>

                    <p>If you decide to NOT file an Answer, you 

should fi le a Notice of Appearance which 

will guarantee that you will receive all future 

pleadings and documents in your court case, 

including notice of sale. If you do not fi le an 

Answer or a Notice of Appearance, the Bank 

is NOT required to send you copies of legal 

documents fi led with the Court later in the 

foreclosure process. Therefore, we HIGHLY 

recommend that you file either an Answer or 

a Notice of Appearance at this point in the 

foreclosure proceeding. 

If you received a Summons and Complaint, 

you have the right to serve and file an Answer 

to the Complaint. Sometimes, however, it 

may not be a good idea to fi le an Answer. You have to make that choice if you are unable to 

fi nd an attorney to help you. There are two 

possible reasons why you may NOT want to 

fi le an Answer.
<ul>
<li>1. You may not have any legal defenses or 

claims to the foreclosure and you simply 

fell behind on your mortgage because of 

a loss of income.</li>

<li>2. If you fi le an Answer and are unsuccessful 

in convincing the Court that you are 

correct, you will be responsible for the 

legal fees that the Bank must pay to 

defend the foreclosure. This will increase 

the amount of money you owe the Bank, 

which could increase the amount of 

money you will have to pay back. This 

ultimately can make it even harder for 

you to obtain a loan modification or some 

other type of workout.</li> </ul></p>
