		<h2> INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SUBIT AN APPEARANCE
        "PRO SE" (Without an attorney)</h2>
        <h2> What is a Notice of Appearance? </h2>
        <p>A Notice of Appearance is a document filed 
with the Court that alerts the Court that you 
would like to be an active participant in the 
foreclosure proceeding. By fi ling a Notice of 
Appearance, you are telling the Court that 
you want copies of all future relevant legal 
documents related to the foreclosure to be 
sent to you. (If you have chosen to fi le an 
Answer, you automatically have made this 
request and do not need to fi le a Notice of 
Appearance.)</p>\
    <h2>Why is it important to file a Notice Apperance?</h2>
		<p>If you decide to NOT file an Answer, you 

should fi le a Notice of Appearance which 

will guarantee that you will receive all future 

pleadings and documents in your court case, 

including notice of sale. If you do not fi le an 

Answer or a Notice of Appearance, the Bank 

is NOT required to send you copies of legal 

documents fi led with the Court later in the 

foreclosure process. Therefore, we HIGHLY 

recommend that you fi le either an Answer or 

a Notice of Appearance at this point in the 

foreclosure proceeding. 

If you received a Summons and Complaint, 

you have the right to serve and fi le an Answer 

to the Complaint. Sometimes, however, it 

may not be a good idea to fi le an Answer. You have to make that choice if you are unable to 

fi nd an attorney to help you. There are two 

possible reasons why you may NOT want to 

fi le an Answer.

1. You may not have any legal defenses or 

claims to the foreclosure and you simply 

fell behind on your mortgage because of 

a loss of income.

2. If you fi le an Answer and are unsuccessful 

in convincing the Court that you are 

correct, you will be responsible for the 

legal fees that the Bank must pay to 

defend the foreclosure. This will increase 

the amount of money you owe the Bank, 

which could increase the amount of 

money you will have to pay back. This 

ultimately can make it even harder for 

you to obtain a loan modifi cation or some 

other type of workout.</p>

        <h2> FILLING OUT THE NOTICE OF APPEARANCE </h2>

        <img src="" />

        <img src="" />

        <h2>STEP 4: "Serve" THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY</h2>
        <p>Ask someone <em>other than yourself</em> who is at 

least 18 years old and not a Defendant in the 

lawsuit to “serve” the fi rst copy of the Notice of 

Appearance on Plaintiff ’s attorney at the address 

listed on the Summons and Complaint. The 

easiest way to “serve” the Notice of Appearance 

is to arrange for the person to send it by certifi ed 

mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight 

delivery service.<em> Be sure to keep the proof of 

mailing and delivery.</em></p>

    <h2>STEP 5: FILL OUT THE AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE</h2>
    <p>The person who “served” the copy of the Notice of 

Appearance on the Plaintiff ’s attorney from step 

4, must fi ll out the Affi davit of Service in front a 

Notary Public and have it notarized. You can often 

fi nd a Notary Public at a branch of your local bank. 

Please be aware they may charge a small fee for 

this service.</p>

    <h2>STEP 6: DATE STAMP AND FILE THE NOTICE OF APPEARANCE AT COUNTY CLERK</h2>

    <p>Bring the original Notice of Appearance, 

the remaining two copies of the Notice of 

Appearance, the original notarized Affi davit of 

Service and a copy of the notarized Affi davit of 

Service to your County Clerk’s offi ce. (See list 

of the local area court clerks included in the 

front folder pocket of this guide.) At the County 

Clerk’s offi ce, state that you wish to fi le a Notice 

of Appearance. Be sure to ask the clerk to “time-
stamp” the original Notice of Appearance, the 

original Affi davit of Service, the two copies of 

the Notice of Appearance, and the copy of the 

Affi davit of Service so that you have proof of the 

date and time you fi led your documents. Keep for 

your records a time stamped copy of the Notice of 

Appearance and a stamped copy of the Affi davit 

of Service.</p>
        <h2>STEP 7: FILE THE NOTICE OF APPEARANCE AT THE SUPREME COURT CLERK</h2>
        <p>Bring the original Notice of Appearance, 

the remaining two copies of the Notice of 

Appearance, the original notarized Affi davit of 

Service and a copy of the notarized Affi davit of 

Service to your County Clerk’s offi ce. (See list 

of the local area court clerks included in the 

front folder pocket of this guide.) At the County 

Clerk’s offi ce, state that you wish to fi le a Notice 

of Appearance. Be sure to ask the clerk to “time-
stamp” the original Notice of Appearance, the 

original Affi davit of Service, the two copies of 

the Notice of Appearance, and the copy of the 

Affi davit of Service so that you have proof of the 

date and time you fi led your documents. Keep for 

your records a time stamped copy of the Notice of 

Appearance and a stamped copy of the Affi davit 

of Service.</p>
