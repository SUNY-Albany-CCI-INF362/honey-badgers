					<div class="small-12 columns">
					<ol>
						<li><p>Adding

columns A and B gives you your “Total Gross 

Household Income.” This amount is $_______. 

Multiply this number by .31. This equals

$_________, and we will refer to this as your 

“31% Payment”. Most of the large banks in 

the country have recently settled on 31% as 

being one of the main standards they use 

in determining if a payment is affordable – 

anything above 31% is often looked at as

being too high. Therefore, your 31% Payment

is an approximate amount you should expect to pay in total for your first mortgage,

homeowners insurance, property taxes and

condo fees/homeowners association fees. 

Remember, there is no law that says you

cannot pay more than 31% -- this is merely 

meant as a guide to give you a better idea

of what many of the national banks have 

recently done. In addition, if you were 

paying less than this before you defaulted, 

be prepared for your mortgage payment to 

increase to this amount each month.</p></li>

						<ol>
							<li>Adding columns C

and D gives you your “Total Household Net 

Income.” This amount is $_______. This is 

how much you actually receive each month, 

and the amount available to pay your bills.
								

							</li>
							<li><h2>MONTHLY EXPENSES</h2>
							<p>	Now that we have looked at your income,

we need to compute your total monthly

expenses. Included on the next page (page

20) is a list of typical household expenses you 

may have each month. Fill in each category

as best you can. We realize that it often can 

be diffi cult to estimate certain categories, 

such as how much you spend on food each 

month. However, it is vital for you to fill this

out as accurately as possible. The only way 

to make an accurate determination if you can 

aff ord your home is to look at what else you 

are spending your money on. You will likely

have to fi ll out a very similar form for your

Bank, so working on your budget now will 

help you.							
</p>
</li>
				<li>Now take each of the subtotals from your

expense list and copy them in below.

<p>Next you need to calculate how much money

you have after you pay all your bills, or how

much more you are spending each month 

than you are earning. Take your Total Net

Income, which you calculated earlier, and

subtract your Total Monthly Expenses, which 

you just calculated.
	


</p>

</li>
<ol>
	<li>Total Net Income 			$____________</li>
	<li>Total Monthly Expenses     $____________</li>
	<li>MONTHLY SURPLUS/DEFICIT		$____________</li>

</ol>
<li>If this amount is negative, it is referred to

as your “monthly deficit”. If this amount is 

positive, it is referred to as your “monthly 

surplus”. If you have a monthly deficit, do 

you see any sources of income that you can 

increase, or any expenses you may be able 

to cut back on? In addition, look at the 31% 

Payment we calculated earlier. If we plugged 

the 31% Payment amount into your budget 

in place of the current Monthly Mortgage 

Payment, would that be enough to turn your 

monthly deficit into a monthly surplus? If not, 

you may not be able to afford your home and you should seriously consider other options 

(such as a “short sale” or a “deed-in-lieu of 

foreclosure”).</li>
