<h1>What should you do to
prepare for your settlement
conference?</h1>
<h2>STEP 1: CONTACT A HUD-APPROVED
HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY</h2>
<p>Located
in the front folder of this guidebook is a list of
your local HUD-approved housing counseling
agencies. If other companies or individuals
tell you that they can help save your home
if you pay them money, you should be
suspicious â€“ often times these are scammers
who are trying to make a quick dollar at your
expense. High quality and expert services
are available for free from the agencies listed
in this guide, and we recommend you contact
one of them if you are looking for help.</p>
<h2>STEP 2: GATHER ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS</h2>
