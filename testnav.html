							Under New York State law, a Settlement 
							Conference must be held if you are living in your 1-to-4 unit home.
							</span>
							 The idea behind 
							the Settlement Conference is to protect the 
							homeowner. By now, many homeowners will 
							have already contacted the Bank to work out 
							a solution. However, banks can be incredibly 
							difficult to work with. Homeowners send the 
							same documents to the Bank many times, 
							only to have the Bank tell them they never 
							received them, or that still more documents 
							are needed. Sometimes, the Bank will take 
							a long time to review your documents, and 
							then tell you that the documents are out of 
							date and therefore you need to send updated 
							documents again.
